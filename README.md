# Angular 2 Tour of Heroes

This is an implementation of Angular 2's "[Tour of Heroes](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/tutorial/toh-pt1.html)" tutorial.

For comparison, check out [the version I built in React](https://github.com/coryhouse/react-tour-of-heroes).

I built this as part of my research for this post: [Angular versus React: There Will Be Blood](https://medium.com/@housecor/angular-2-versus-react-there-will-be-blood-66595faafd51#.p1ucoabov)

#Get Started
